guided reading I'm Jan Richardson and

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I've created this video series based on

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
the many requests I've gotten from

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
teachers who want to see lessons in

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
action these model lessons are designed

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
to show you just how powerful and

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
effective guided reading can be in

your students become better readers as a

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
key part of a literacy program guided

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
reading will help your students build

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
the foundational skills they'll need to

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
meet and exceed standards these video

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
clips cover the full gamut of readers

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:45.000
you're likely to find in a primary

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
classroom there are lessons for pre a

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
emergent early transitional and even

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
fluent readers you'll see how small

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
group guided reading lessons meet the

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
needs of all readers English language

00:03:10.014 --> 00:03:13.959
Listen,
listen to the sounds of the machine.

00:03:18.054 --> 00:03:20.009
Listen to your breathing.

00:04:27.001 --> 00:04:28.956
Well, don't you ever get tired of this?

00:04:29.084 --> 00:04:30.909
Tired?!?

00:04:31.126 --> 00:04:34.491
Emo, the machine is like clockwork.

00:04:35.083 --> 00:04:37.074
One move out of place...

00:04:37.166 --> 00:04:39.121
...and you're ground to a pulp.

00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.004
But isn't it -

00:04:42.041 --> 00:04:46.034
Pulp, Emo!
Is that what you want, pulp?

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.995
Emo, your goal in life...

00:04:50.081 --> 00:04:51.953
...pulp?

00:05:41.156 --> 00:05:43.028
Emo, close your eyes.

00:05:44.156 --> 00:05:46.027
Why?
- Now!

00:05:51.155 --> 00:05:52.102
Ok.

00:05:53.113 --> 00:05:54.688
Good.

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:02.103
What do you see at your left side, Emo?

00:06:04.028 --> 00:06:05.899
Nothing.
- Really?

00:06:06.027 --> 00:06:07.105
No, nothing at all.

00:06:07.944 --> 00:06:11.984
And at your right,
what do you see at your right side, Emo?

00:06:13.151 --> 00:06:16.102
The same Proog, exactly the same...

00:06:16.942 --> 00:06:19.098
...nothing!
- Great.

00:06:40.105 --> 00:06:42.724
Listen Proog! Do you hear that!

00:06:43.105 --> 00:06:44.894
Can we go here?

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:47.894
There?
It isn't safe, Emo.

00:06:49.145 --> 00:06:52.013
But...
- Trust me, it's not.

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:54.145
Maybe I could...

00:06:54.181 --> 00:06:55.969
No.

00:06:57.102 --> 00:06:59.934
NO!

00:07:00.144 --> 00:07:03.058
Any further questions, Emo?

00:07:03.976 --> 00:07:05.090
No.

00:07:09.059 --> 00:07:10.089
Emo?

00:07:11.142 --> 00:07:13.058
Emo, why...

00:07:13.095 --> 00:07:14.022
Emo...

00:07:14.058 --> 00:07:18.003
...why can't you see
the beauty of this place?

00:07:18.141 --> 00:07:20.048
The way it works.

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:23.895
How perfect it is.

00:07:23.932 --> 00:07:26.964
No, Proog, I don't see.

00:07:27.056 --> 00:07:29.970
I don't see because there's nothing there.

00:07:31.055 --> 00:07:34.965
And why should I trust my
life to something that isn't there?

00:07:35.055 --> 00:07:36.926
Well can you tell me that?

00:07:37.054 --> 00:07:38.926
Answer me!

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:44.000
Proog...

00:07:45.053 --> 00:07:46.985
...you're a sick man!

00:07:47.022 --> 00:07:48.918
Stay away from me!

00:07:52.052 --> 00:07:54.884
No! Emo! It's a trap!

00:07:55.135 --> 00:07:56.931
Hah, it's a trap.

00:07:56.968 --> 00:08:01.043
At the left side you can see
the hanging gardens of Babylon!

00:08:01.967 --> 00:08:03.957
How's that for a trap?

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:06.922
No, Emo.

00:08:09.008 --> 00:08:12.088
At the right side you can see...
...well guess what...

00:08:12.924 --> 00:08:14.665
...the colossus of Rhodes!

00:08:15.132 --> 00:08:16.053
No!

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:21.919
The colossus of Rhodes
and it is here just for you Proog.

00:08:51.001 --> 00:08:52.923
It is there...

00:08:52.959 --> 00:08:56.040
I'm telling you,
Emo...

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.867
...it is.
