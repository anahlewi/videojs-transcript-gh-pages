welcome to this video series next step

2
00:05-->00:08
guided reading in action this series is

3
00:08-->00:10 
an outgrowth of my book the next step in

4
00:10-->00:12 
guided reading I'm Jan Richardson and

5
00:12-->00:15 
I've created this video series based on

6
00:15--> 00:16 
the many requests I've gotten from

7
00:16--> 00:19 
teachers who want to see lessons in

8
00:19-->00:22 
action these model lessons are designed

9
00:22-->00:24 
to show you just how powerful and

10
00:24-->00:26 
effective guided reading can be in

11
00:26--> 00 :28
improving your instruction and helping

12
00 :28-->00:30 
your students become better readers as a

13
00:30--> 00:33 
key part of a literacy program guided

14
00:33--> 00:35 
reading will help your students build

15
00:35-->00:37
the foundational skills they'll need to

16
00:37-->00:41
meet and exceed standards these video

17
00:41-->00:43
clips cover the full gamut of readers

18
00:43-->00:45
you're likely to find in a primary

19
00:45-->00:47 
classroom there are lessons for pre a

20
00:47-->00:51 
emergent early transitional and even

21
00:51-->00:54 
fluent readers you'll see how small

22
00:54-->00:56 
group guided reading lessons meet the

23
00:56-->00:58 
needs of all readers English language

24
00:58-->01:01 
learners struggling readers and those

25
01:01-->01:04 
reading on an above grade level the pre

26
01:04-->01:06 
a lesson set helps you better understand

27
01:06-->01:08 
and support children with limited

28
01:08-->01:11 
preschool experiences or those who are

29
01:11-->01:13 
learning how to speak and read English

30
01:13-->01:16 
I'll show you how to help these budding

31
01:16-->01:18 
readers reach goals at the pre a level

32
01:18-->01:21
including how to learn letters and

33
01:21-->01:23
sounds how to increase phonemic

34
01:23-->01:25
awareness how to become familiar with

35
01:25-->01:28
print concepts and how to link letters

36
01:28-->01:30
and sounds to write a simple message

37
01:30-->01:40
with the teacher tremendous growth

38
01:40-->01:43
happens between pre a and the next stage

39
01:43-->01:46
emergent reading you'll see how emergent

40
01:46-->01:48
readers have learned most of the letters

41
01:48-->01:50
and sounds and are ready to learn

42
01:50-->01:53
reading strategies such as checking the

43
01:53-->01:55
picture and using initial letters to

44
01:55-->01:58
figure out new words how did you know

45
01:58-->02:01
that was hill and not rock yay

46
02:01-->02:04
8 your lesson plans will include helping

47
02:04-->02:06
emergent readers learn some easy sight

48
02:06-->02:09
words and use known letter sounds during

49
02:09-->02:13
reading and writing

50
02:13-->02:17
like a child at the early reading stage

51
02:17-->02:19
is developing more strategies for

52
02:19-->02:21
decoding as the student gains

53
02:21-->02:24
automaticity with words you'll see an

54
02:24-->02:26
increase in fluency at this point the

55
02:26-->02:28
books the children read have a story

56
02:28-->02:30
light so you'll want to teach them to

57
02:30-->02:33
retell and discuss the story and you'll

58
02:33-->02:35
notice how I really push these

59
02:35-->02:38
comprehension elements in my lessons

60
02:38-->02:40
with them what did the puppy do and he

61
02:40-->02:43
didn't get the food he cry cried so

62
02:43-->02:44
maybe they felt sorry for the puppy

63
02:44-->02:46
because he was crying it's the word

64
02:46-->02:48
study with early readers targets

65
02:48-->02:51
phonetic skills such as digraphs lends

66
02:51--02:55
the silent e feature and vowel patterns

67
02:55-->02:57
transitional readers can be found in any

68
02:57-->03:00
grade but they are most often reading at

69
03:00-->03:02
the second grade level they have many

70
03:02-->03:04
sight words under their belt and are

71
03:04-->03:05
learning how to handle words with

72
03:05-->03:08
multiple syllables correctly what helped

73
03:08-->03:09
you with this word was there a part that

74
03:09-->03:11
the first part there what was the first

75
03:11-->03:15
part d the stories at this stage are

76
03:15-->03:18
becoming more complex so students can

77
03:18-->03:21
compare and contrast characters ideas

78
03:21-->03:23
and themes you'll want to use a variety

79
03:23-->03:26
of genres so students learn different

80
03:26-->03:27
strategies for understanding and

81
03:27-->03:30
discussing narrative informational texts

82
03:30-->03:34
and even poetry if you teach second

83
03:34-->03:36
grade you may have some fluent readers

84
03:36-->03:38
in your class students who are good at

85
03:38-->03:41
self-monitoring decoding fluency and

86
03:41-->03:43
retail and who have the background

87
03:43-->03:47
knowledge to tackle advanced books as I

88
03:47-->03:49
do with the students in the fluent model

89
03:49-->03:51
lesson you'll want to challenge your

90
03:51-->03:53
strong readers with complex texts that

91
03:53-->03:55
require a variety of comprehension

92
03:55-->03:58
strategies what did you learn on this

93
03:58-->04:01
page about their smell a polar bear can

94
04:01-->04:05
smell and sale from a mile away so it

95
04:05-->04:08
has strong smell we've designed the next

96
04:08-->04:11
step guided reading in action videos to

97
04:11-->04:13
help you fully understand and master the

98
04:13-->04:16
guided reading process with each reading

99
04:16-->04:19
stage you will find a reader profile and

100
04:19-->04:21
a step-by-step guide on how to plan a

101
04:21-->04:24
lesson you'll also be able to watch an

102
04:24-->04:26
actual guided reading lesson

103
04:26-->04:28
and see short clips that demonstrate

104
04:28-->04:31
specific teaching points one of the most

105
04:31-->04:33
valuable things you will learn in this

106
04:33-->04:36
video series is how to use your

107
04:36-->04:38
assessment data to plan and teach a

108
04:38-->04:40
guided reading lesson that targets

109
04:40-->04:43
individual needs before teaching each

110
04:43-->04:45
lesson in this series I met with the

111
04:45-->04:48
classroom teachers together we looked at

112
04:48-->04:51
the assessment data identified a focused

113
04:51-->04:53
strategy and selected an appropriate

114
04:53-->04:55
book and so we chose this great Gracie

115
04:55-->04:58
chase it's a nice storyline it's got a

116
04:58-->05:00
beginning middle and end has some

117
05:00-->05:03
details as I'm teaching you'll see me

118
05:03-->05:05
prompt and scaffold to help students

119
05:05-->05:07
develop independence with the focus

120
05:07-->05:10
strategy after each lesson I share my

121
05:10-->05:13
reflections and offer suggestions for

122
05:13-->05:16
the next guided reading experience don't

123
05:16-->05:18
forget to dig into the resources that

124
05:18-->05:21
accompany this set of video clips in the

125
05:21-->05:22
view and do guide you'll find

126
05:22-->05:25
suggestions for using this video series

127
05:25-->05:27
as a professional learning tool there

128
05:27-->05:30
are also helpful questions and teaching

129
05:30-->05:32
tips and alignments to common core

130
05:32-->05:35
standards the CD contains the actual

131
05:35-->05:39
lesson plans and assessment forms I used

132
05:39-->05:41
for the model lessons I suggest you

133
05:41-->05:43
follow along with them as you view each

134
05:43-->05:43
lesson you'll find the same blank forms
